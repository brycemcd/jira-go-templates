# Jira Templates

Templates specific to my own preferences.

Config file:

Jira CLI expects a config yaml file in ~/.jira.d/config.yml . I'm not
tracking that in any other repo so I'll track it here.

When installing this project on another system, link the file in this
repo to where the CLI expects to see it:

`ln -s config.yml ~/.jira.d/config.yml`
